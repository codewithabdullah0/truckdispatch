                      How we can help freight brokers and shippers
                  </h1>

                  <p className="truck-services-para11">
                      One of the biggest advantages we provide freight brokers and shippers is our extensive pool of independent owner-operators eager to assist with their loads. Our drivers have all cleared our approval process and are ready to service your needs. Other ways American Movers can help include:

                  </p>

                  <p className="truck-services-para11">
                      ✔ <span>Eliminate double brokering.</span>  Double brokering is illegal unless the shipper consents to the arrangement. However, that does not stop some companies from engaging in the practice without the knowledge of the clients they represent. As independent dispatchers, we never double broker your loads. We work solely as independent dispatchers for drivers with whom we can provide all documentation. <br />
                      ✔ <span>Offer transparency.</span>  From our pricing model to updates about the progress of your load, we offer full transparency to freight brokers and carriers. Dispatchers keep track of preferred carriers and routes to ensure a smoother process each time you use our services. <br />
                      ✔ <span>Provide 24/7 updates.</span>  Our team never leaves freight brokers hanging. We provide timely updates on your loads during every leg of the journey. Potential delays or problems are communicated immediately. We are available 24/7 to track loads, answer your questions and concerns, and ensure your shipments arrive as planned. <br />
                  </p>

                  <p className="truck-services-para11">
                      Most freight brokers and shippers do not have the time required to locate a freight forwarder on their own. You can trust our team at American Movers with the most fragile cargo and the tightest deadlines. We find the best, most cost-efficient shipping solutions to meet your needs every time.
